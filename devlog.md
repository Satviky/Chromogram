# Satviky's Index Rule
[These are the rules i learnt in my journey.]
## 1. In dev and life, a smart index beats an unstructured dump.
Wrote this while studying indexing in DBMS.
> An organized mind — like an optimized query — moves faster. Whether in projects, thoughts, or codebases, structure always beats chaos. Unless...


## 2. "never underestimate chaos energy"
Wrote this when i had no hope of my code working because of chaotic way programming was done, but it was better than expectation.
> Sometimes messy code, unclear logic, and rapid experimentation create results that structured planning could never predict. Trust your instincts — even if they look wild.


## 3. "Done is beautiful. Shipped is stronger than perfect."
It have a big significance. I had half build app, it is okay. Now, I talked to few people about the app, and they loved it instead of laughing at me for not talking after completion of building but in middle.
> Here, `Done is beautiful` means that, whatever you have done till now in your app, it's beautiful. Even if you wanted something else, but at least you came this far.

> Now, `shipped is stronger than perfect` means that, An App in prodcution[with all the bugs and glitches included] is more powerful and strong than a idea which have neve been launched in the market.
