This is spin off to the classic Cryptogram game.[^1]
## 🎯 What's New
* **[Feature 1]:** Introduced a new save system that correctly tracks progress per unique player (instead of always defaulting to player ID)
* **[Bug Fix 1]:** "First few apks crashed before opening, that have been fixed."
* **General Stability:** Play through the game normally and report any unexpected behavior or crashes.


>[!important]
>Spin-off doesn't mean copy of the previously built game, it means improvised version of the game/app you are already familiar with.

## 💡 Inspiration
Chromogram is inspired by cryptogram puzzles — but with a twist. I wanted to create a colour-centric version where every tap feels intuitive and rewarding, even to people who don’t play traditional word games.
